# RBN-soil-detector-project-1-2-PD

This project is a Soil Moisture Detection System. It measures the water content in soil, helping plants get the right amount of water. It prevents overwatering and underwatering, conserves water, and supports healthy plant growth. The system can be integrated with automatic irrigation setups for smart watering and is useful for agricultural efficiency, gardening, and research purposes.

## Laser Cutting workshop

As part of this project, I attended hands-on workshops that helped me gain essential fabrication and prototyping skills.
- Laser Cutting Workshop â€“ Learned about routine checks, machine maintenance, carbon air filters, focusing tools, bed leveling, and engraving techniques.
- CNC and Additive Manufacturing  â€“ We explored subtractive vs. additive manufacturing, CNC routing operations, tool bits, spindle motors, safety practices, and software workflows.
- Design Tools â€“ Practiced CAD design in Onshape, generated toolpaths using Kiri:Moto, and prepared files for laser cutting.

## Conclusion 
Thank you for checking out the Soil Moisture Detector System! This project provides a simple and effective way to monitor soil moisture, conserve water, and support healthy plant growth.

**For future improvements I will:**
- Improve the system by integrating an automatic irrigation pump.
- Add mobile app or web interface for real-time monitoring remotely.
- Experiment with different soil sensors to increase accuracy.
