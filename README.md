# RBN-soil-detector-project-1-2-PD

This project is a Soil Moisture Detection System. It measures soil moisture levels and provides feedback using an LCD display and 3 LEDs.  
The device helps prevent overwatering or underwatering, making it suitable for home gardening or agriculture

## Hardware components

| Component | Description |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soil Moisture Sensor Probes | Detects the moisture level in the soil by measuring conductivity. |
| 16x2 LCD Display (I2C) | Displays real-time readings such as soil moisture percentage. |
| LED Indicators (Green/Orange/Red) | Visual feedback: Green = Good, Orange = Moderate, Red = Low moisture. |
| Push Button / Power Switch | Turns the device ON/OFF or resets readings. |
| Battery Pack / Power Supply | Provides portable power to the system. |
| Casing/Enclosure | Protects the electronics and provides a compact handheld design. |
