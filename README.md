# RBN-soil-detector-project-1-2-PD

This project is a Soil Moisture Detection System. It measures soil moisture levels and provides feedback using an LCD display and 3 LEDs.  
The device helps prevent overwatering or underwatering, making it suitable for home gardening or agriculture

##Features

Soil Moisture Detection – Reads soil hydration levels in real-time using a soil moisture sensor.
LED Status Indicators –
Green LED → Soil is wet enough
Orange LED → Soil is moderately dry
Red LED → Soil is too dry, watering needed
LCD Display (16x2 I2C) – Shows live readings for soil moisture, temperature, and light levels.
Light Detection – Photoresistor (LDR) monitors light intensity for environmental awareness.
Temperature Monitoring – TMP36 sensor measures soil/ambient temperature.
Serial Monitor Output – Arduino IDE Serial Monitor displays detailed readings for debugging and analysis.
Compact & Portable Design – Custom 3D-printed case included for easy assembly and protection.
